# EEInformation
The Datasets and Programs used in my Extended Essay for IB
The adding program is Add.py

In Regression:
Response variables for linear regression is ys.p
Explanatory variables are xs.p
Elastic Net regression is Package.py
Pure Python VIF Regression is PureVif.py, and implementation of the regression is VifRegression.py
Custom Extension VIF Regression and data generation is Real.py, note that Real.py is run with the custom python extension in linux, while PureVif.py is run in windows, hence why they import what appears to be the same module.

In KCLUSTERING:
Dataset saved in data.txt as a string literal, generated by NormalDataGenerator.py
Existing extension Clustering is Package.py
Pure Python Clustering is DataLoader.py, with KClustering implementation in KClustering.py
Custom Python Extension Clustering is also DataLoader.py, with run in linux with custom extension named KClustering

The C++ source for the extensions can be found in the respective C++ folders along with my personal built libraries, they may not work on your machine.
