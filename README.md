The Datasets and Programs used in my Extended Essay for IB
The adding program featured in the paper is named Add.py

In the Regression Folder:
Response variable for linear regression is ys.p (pickle file)
Explanatory variables are xs.p (pickle file)
Elastic Net regression program is named Package.py
Pure Python VIF Regression is named PureVif.py, and the implementation of the VIF regression is VifRegression.py
The VIF Regression and data generation program is Real.py, note that Real.py is run with the custom python extension in linux, while PureVif.py is run in windows, hence why they import what appears to be the same module.

In the KCLUSTERING Folder:
K-Clustering dataset saved in data.txt as a python string literal, generated by NormalDataGenerator.py;
Existing extension Clustering is Package.py;
Pure Python Clustering is DataLoader.py, with KClustering implementation in KClustering.py;
Custom Python Extension Clustering is also DataLoader.py, with run in linux with custom extension named KClustering

The C++ source for the extensions can be found in the respective C++ folders along with the libraries I built, they will probably not work on your machine.
